Nothing too crazy this week, just attending a couple days' training for situational awareness as I work as a frontline outreach worker part-time.

Charging up with some Tim Hortons before the PowerPoint onslaught

To be fair, we learned a lot over the past 2 days at it wasn't just hours and hours of slides, but we did a lot of role-playing and scenarios. I prefer practical training so it was very beneficial in the end.

It was great that I get to hang out and spend more time with my coworkers as I only work a few shifts a week - and for our last training day we all chipped in and bought around $300 worth of sushi for lunch!
