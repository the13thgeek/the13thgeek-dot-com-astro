Here I am on a late Sunday evening, recovering (in a good way!) from a very busy week. It's been a while since I've had a busy week, social-wise. It was actually pretty noteworthy.


##### **Monday**

It was Canadian Thanksgiving. I usually love this day because other than the fact that it's a holiday, it's one of the few days of the year I temporarily loosen my dietary restrictions and I let myself eat whatever I want.

This year's been pretty challenging for me life and career-wise. It's difficult to feel thankful after losing my job in the spring and still struggling to find employment in a very expensive city. These last few months I've had to actively choose to decide to keep fighting every waking moment. I'm surviving so far.

But this week is just about to remind me that the fight isn't over yet, and I still have a lot of reasons to be thankful for.

I met up with some good friends who are passing through the city in the afternoon and we hung out around Union Station and checked out the new gashapon store. You read that right. *Gashapon*, in Toronto!

We had a lot of fun just looking around and checking out all the cool stuff they have here. I normally only see these Bandai gashapon machines at conventions that I attend. It's a refreshing sight to see this in the city at such an accessible location. I pulled and got a few cool Kamen Rider items. The staff mentioned that they rotate the goodies every few days. I made a mental note to make it a habit of checking this place out when I (fingers crossed) get a new job downtown.


##### Tuesday

My Employment Insurance is not going to last forever and for the last few months I've submitted a hundred applications or so to zero success. With that in mind, I figured I have to do something before help runs out. I reached out to a few agencies and a local organization, Achev was nice enough to take me in.

I had my first appointment with a career counselor. I relayed my situation and had them initially review my resume. Just like when I got laid off in 2013, I've learned to be open to options, and it looks like they would be happy to accommodate me. Later this week they will begin helping me with my resume and job-hunting. Fingers crossed.

I needed help. I'm getting help.

Later in the day I met up with another local friend whom I haven't talked to in a while. We've both had our rollercoaster share of events, and it was nice to grab some food and catch up. I have a few low-maintenance friends in the city and it's always nice to know that despite the fact that we don't always talk, I know they're just around.


##### Wednesday

Hump days are usually the days I take a break from streaming, but since I won't be able to stream over the weekend, I hosted a Left 4 Dead 2 game with a big group of online friends. It's funny because until that evening, I had no idea I could play as an Infected with the Versus mode!

Halloween is one of my favourite times of the year, and I'm starting to feel it more when I saw what's projected on the CN Tower.

Despite living here for two years now, I will never get tired of looking up at this majestic megastructure.


##### Thursday

For the next few days, I would be hanging out with some friends from Winnipeg. They flew in to watch One Ok Rock perform and hang out with us. I met these lovely folks from streaming and another funny thought occurred to me: during my time in Winnipeg, I've always had difficulties making friends because it still had that small-town mentality and people tend to be more insular, but now that I've moved to Toronto, I've started making more friends from Winnipeg.

To start off their short trip, we had some Japanese grill and checked out a cat cafe downtown.

The cat cafe was fun. At one point during our visit, I was tempted to adopt a cat but I realized that my roommate is allergic to them and I tend to travel a lot and be away for many days. Probably not right now.


##### Friday

I rejoined their group again and this time, we walked around downtown and because it's my neck of the woods I became their tour guide. We checked out the shops on Queen and the bars on King. With the sunset now becoming earlier, I even caught a nice glimpse of Union during the golden hour.

Walking and showing tourist friends reminded me how much I enjoyed strolling around this area back when I was still working. Since I got laid off I haven't been exploring the downtown core as much as I used to. I love this place.

We went to check out The Well afterwards. It's a very touristy place. Not much stores open yet, and it looks like it's mostly geared towards a wealthier crowd, but we didn't let that ruin the fun. We grabbed some Japadog (yes, we have one here now!) for dinner before they were off to watch One Ok Rock.


##### Saturday

It was their last day in the city today, so we figured we'd make the most out of the day. We had some ramen to start, and checked out the newly-opened Japanese arcade place called Yume Arcade in Chinatown. 

I was in for a pleasant surprise. Not only they have DDR A3 and Sound Voltex  in there, but they brought in the DanceManiaX game that I used to play a lot when I was younger back in the Philippines!

I'm pretty much about 90% recovered from my surgery, so I did not pass up on the opportunity to play again!

Hello there, old friend. We meet again! Looks like I no longer have to make the one-hour trek to Vaughan just to play DDR. There's one right in my area now and they have more rhythm games! My inner nerd is happy.

We went to play an escape room game on a pirate ship that's docked at the waterfront. We were split into three groups and began to work on trying to open a locked treasure chest with seven locks on them.

Long story short, only one of the groups (not ours, unfortunately) managed to "escape" the cursed pirate ship. But it was one hell of a good time!

We wrapped up the rest of the evening back in Chinatown, grabbing some soup dumplings and sang the rest of the night away in karaoke!

I spent today resting and thanking the Winnipeg folk for visiting and inviting me to spend time with them.

It's been a rough few months, but this week reminded me that despite that, there's still a good amount of reason to be thankful for. Living in a great city with a lot of things to do having a good set of friends both in and out of the city are just to name a few.

I'll be back on my usual grind this coming week, and while I'm not looking forward to continuously plow through job listings, editing and sending out resumes, I am getting help and I will keep trying.

Work on this site's Next.js conversion and more updates for the PMC Planner will resume as well.
