The long road to recovery begins.

I spent the first half of last week in the Shouldice hospital here in the GTA. I've had to undergo surgery and while I was in the hospital I would take advantage of the hourly exercises to walk around the grounds and ensure a faster recovery.

Looking forward to the hoodie season, the colourful and leaves, and of course, Halloween!

While I'm spending the last few days recovering, I was able to make some progress working on this site and the Morphicon project.

The blog section is now functional (as you can see from this post), and I've began considering converting this site into a multi-page NextJS implementation for better SEO. I'm still weighing options between performing a huge in-place update on the code repository or begin dev work on a brand-new one and create a new routing from scratch and re-import existing pages and components.

On the PMC Planner side of things, I have been looking into React libraries and figured I can sort of re-write the entire thing using the MUI library. I forgot libraries like these exist and I've spent a huge chunk of my time designing components from scratch. Why do that when I could use a library and make everything look more streamlined, consistent and easily themeable, right? And it looks like MUI supports searchable data tables, so that means I don't need to reinvent the wheel.

Still a lot of learning to do!

As for Twitch, I've paused on streaming for a bit while I fully recover, but I should be able to stream again hopefully later this week. I think I just need a few more days to let some more of the post-recovery discomfort dissipate.

I'm thinking of breaking down this site's Twitch page into separate components as I've noticed a lot of repeating elements, maybe play around with the carousel too. 

The thing I like about learning programming is I can iterate. I code a page/project now, and every time I learn something new, I go back to it and change things. Whether it's a new way of implementing things such as shorthand expressions or a new function/library, it's exciting to implement something new and possibly better.
