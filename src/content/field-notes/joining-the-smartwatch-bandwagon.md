It's a chilly, rainy day today - perfect day for pho!

Meatballs and briskets pho for lunch!

This was my first pho since November of last year, thanks to our never-ending cycle of Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions. It's still as good as I remember it! :)

So it finally happened - after years of contemplating whether to get a smartwatch or not, I caved in!

Back in mid-August I preordered the 42mm version of the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, but somehow I wasn't the only person who wants in! Turns out Samsung did not expect the influx of demand and my online preorder somehow got delayed and backlogged despite being promised that I will receive the item earlier than its planned retail release date, yikes!

Apparently, I'm not the only one whose order got pushed back. After reading several Reddit threads, some people have suggested to check Best Buy and see if they have some in-store ones for pickup. I checked my local one and voila - they have a 46mm one available! I didn't waste any more second and I ordered one for store pickup! Within half an hour later, I got a confirmation saying they have secured the watch for me!

From 42mm to 46mm!!

I ended up cancelling my preorder from Samsung - too bad, I'll miss out on the free wireless charger duo, but it's better than having to wait another few weeks for the backlog! Besides, Best Buy gave a $60 rebate on my purchase and the chance to have it the same day!

At first I was concerned about how big the 46mm's gonna be on my tiny wrists, but turns out even this bigger Classic model is still way smaller and more compact that my good ol' trusty G-Shock:

Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 46mm and a Casio G-Shock comparison

My only real gripe about the whole thing is the silicone band that came with it. Somehow it's still stiff and doesn't bend a lot, leaving out a lot of space on the sides of my wrist. Maybe it should soften over time, and I have a custom band coming in from Amazon over the next few days.

I'm liking it so far, and tomorrow morning I'm planning to put this to the test when I go on my weekend runs. I have a Note 10+ and Galaxy Buds Live so hopefully those 3 devices should play nicely with each other!

Hopefully this should help me lessen the time I spend looking at my phone too much! 😂

I'm keeping my G-Shock... I've had a lot of adventures with it, and considering smartwatch battery lives, it can act as a backup watch in case Mr. Watch 4 Classic here decides to die on me in the middle of the day.

Here's to the smart devices life! 🥂
