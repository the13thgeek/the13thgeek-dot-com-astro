We've been planning this for a while now, glad it we finally had some! :D

Hot pot, anyone?

After work today we gathered to my coworker's place to finally have some hot pot after such a long time of planning.

Bring on the spices!

After eating we even managed to play Smash and Mario Kart using my co-worker's projector. I have to admit, it's pretty cool to play on a giant screen!

Thanks Arianne for being gracious enough to provide a sense of scale on how large the screen was :D

_PS - My Smash skills suck, and I've been playing for 8 months. LOL_
