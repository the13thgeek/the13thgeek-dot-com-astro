Been quite a rough month, but I'm glad November's over and done with, and I capped it off with some Black Friday shopping!

I got myself some smart-home stuff - a Philips Hue LED strip (thinking of using this for some flexible action photography lighting), a Chromecast, and a few new plane models for my mini airport diorama in my room! All thanks to my price tracker emails! :D

Speaking of which, I just realized I never really wrote about this. I'm actually a low-key aviation enthusiast growing up. I love planes, airports and aviation in general. I just recently started collecting some 1:400 scale airplane models and set up a small airport in my room!

I've always wanted to follow Boom! Studios' Power Rangers comic series since it started in 2016 but I was too busy to be going into a comic store to get a new issue every month so I figured I wait for any sorts of compilations... spoiler alert: I still did not, until now.

Three years later, I began to realize how much I wanted to get on with it when I passed on two annual hardcover compilations which are now out of print and going for crazy prices online.

However, with the help of a few friends online I managed to secure all 3 years' worth of the hardcovers of this amazing comic series!

The reviews have been amazing, and the fact that they're hardbound sealed the deal for me, and next year I won't miss out again. I can't wait for these books to arrive in the mail and start catching up!

I got a free _Pokémon Shield_ game through Air Miles, so now I'm slowly making my way on to Hammerlocke. At this point I somehow slowed down considerably as I wanted to catch a lot of pokémon but I kept accidentally fainting them so I got frustrated for a bit and put the game down for a few days.

I then remembered about the _False Swipe_ TM, which I was able to acquire from one of the shops in-game but none of the pokémon in my party nor boxes are able to learn the move. Online sources point to getting Ralts, which I was having trouble with due to the disagreeing weather conditions in-game. Apparently, I'm not having enough luck with RNG either, so once again I turned to my friends for help.

One traded a Ralts with me, and another one gave me a Dawn stone. Whew!! What would I be without my friends? :)

My last Black Friday haul was unexpected - one of my friends hooked me up with a contact who works at a local wireless store and managed to help me get an irresistible deal to upgrade my phone from a Galaxy S9 to a Note 10+!

I've always wanted a Note since I find the stylus useful and with the help of some apps, get to practice my artistic skills that were lost in grade school. I've been eyeing on the Note 10+ since it was announced due to its new camera with the new lenses and features but I couldn't find an affordable deal until now.

Once again, what would I be without my friends? :)

Remember that Corned Beef hoodie from the Kamen Rider series I've been trying to acquire for cosplay purposes? It's en route in the mail!

If anyone's wondering, I got them off the Japanese P-Bandai site through a middleman service.

I'm gonna have quite a loot coming in. It's going to be exiting! :D
