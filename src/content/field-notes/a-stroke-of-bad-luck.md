I am, in reality, a believer **Murphy's Law**. Things can go wrong, and very likely will go wrong. While I'm not a complete pessimist, I'd always assume that something will go awry at some point, and they sure did...

For some odd reason, I lost my wallet today. For the first time in 20 or so years, I lost my friggin' wallet! It was frustrating, knowing that I almost have everything there - from bank cards, eAmusement Pass, driver's license, you know it. I normally don't bring all my cards at the same time but of course it has to go missing when I have everything in it. :'(

The thing is, I have completely zero idea where or when I misplaced it. I've always taken care of my personal things (always kept them secure) and I've never lost a wallet for the past 20 or so years so this completely threw me off the rails for the entire evening.

Now I'm on my call 4 out of I-don't-know-how-many-more awkward phone calls I have to make for different banks to report my lost card. They gave me a reminder to bring an ID to the bank tomorrow to get my new card issues... but wait, I don't have my driver's license, it's lost, remember? :(

I ordered a few action figure props from a propmaker online, and after waiting for it to arrive in the mail for so long...

That's right. There's nothing in it!

I checked every nook and cranny in the box... it looks like they may have sent the empty box by mistake. I contacted them and while they're willing to re-send another one, they informed me that I will have to wait as they are going on a break for a week or so...

Looking at the North American Premium Bandai site, I was ecstatic to see that they're putting up the outfits that the characters wear in Kamen Rider Zero One and I quickly tried to place an order for one of Aruto's signature _Corned Beef_ hoodies, then I was greeted with this not-so-friendly error message:

Apparently they no longer ship to Canada as of July this year. I guess I was 4 months too late.

Why is it so difficult to be a Canadian toku fan? :'(
