Hello. It's been such a long time, hasn't it? I think it's been three years since my last blogging attempt. This is my fifth attempt into getting back to writing again. It's been a whirlwind of events ever since - I know I barely have enough time to catch a breath let alone write lengthy blog entries like I used to, but I've been on so many adventures over the past three years and they were left _undocumented_.

No, I do not really consider Facebook posts as a documentation of what has happened since I never really post lengthy stuff. Every time I'd travel somewhere or attend a comic convention or an IT conference, I would post random photos here and there but the substance was never there. I would use the Timeline feature to look back into them and while it's been useful, those short posts and photos never captured _what really happened_. I wanted a full chronicle - to be able to look back on those events and recall all the adventures in more detail. Many people say I'm a natural storyteller, so here I am, about to dive headfirst into blogging again.

I'm a person of many \[niche\] interests - Power Rangers/Super Sentai, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Kamen Rider, Web development, Star Wars, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Parks & Recreation, BEMANI music games, Tamagotchi, Smash Brothers, Splatoon, Pokemon, cosplay, a bit of anime here and there, action figure photography and of course, travel. Unfortunately there's not many people I could talk to about these things passionately. While I have many close friends whom I can share these things with, most of them are people who are not in my city - I met all these awesome folks online and in the events I attend outside of the city and even overseas. This motivated me to restart this blog.

With all these diverse interests that I have, I figured these would give me enough material to write and share with. Since most of the things I like to talk about are mostly niche and have a small reach, it's a huge untapped reader audience. It's a good way for me to practice my writing skills and hopefully readers might find the things I talk about interesting enough to read and learn more about.

If you've made it this far, thanks for dropping by! There's nothing much going on in this blog at the moment... but hey, we gotta start somewhere!

_Note to self: Back to blogging! But yeah, no pressure this time. Just write about whatever, whenever. :)_
