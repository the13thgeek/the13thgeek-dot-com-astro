Yesterday, two of my close friends tied the knot; and I'm one of the fortunate people whom have been chosen to bear witness!

A wedding is a very important event in person's life - not only for the people getting married but for everyone close to them as well. It's a celebration of the love of two people that culminates into a lifetime bond and a celebration of family and friends as well, as people gather and to some extent, fly in just to be able to witness such a momentous event.

I was at the latter part - I was fortunate to have been chosen as one of the groomsmen together with some other close friends. In our adult lives, it's always been hard to organize events as everyone's work schedules are hectic, so the wedding doubles as a small reunion for us as well!

There's always time for shenanigans!
