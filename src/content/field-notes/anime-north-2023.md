It's been a hot minute since last ComiCon back in March, and I wasn't been able to make the most out of that because I got sick in the middle of the convention weekend and it was terrible, so for this year's Anime North I made sure to make the most out of it.

We didn't attend the first day as I was busy with work and I had a scheduled Twitch stream with friends the same evening, but we were there for both Saturday and Sunday!

My two lineups were the same as Comicon - Don Momotaro (as Gokai Red) for Saturday and Geats DGP on Sunday!

I had fun cosplaying both! I was making a Gokaiger/Donbrothers reference with my Sunday cosplay and I was pleasantly surprised when some people caught both.

I love the DGP uniform. There's something about the futuristic paramilitary style of it that makes anyone wearing it look sharp and powerful.

Of course this convention isn't complete without my awesome cosplay friends! They're one of the reasons I moved to Toronto. I've always cosplayed alone back in the prairies; but here I have friends I can actually chill with; conventions or otherwise. They were my main source of energy for the entire weekend.
