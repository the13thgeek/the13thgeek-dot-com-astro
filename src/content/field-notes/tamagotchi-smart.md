Welp, I just preordered a smart watch... I've been collecting the recent colour Tamagotchi versions so I can't miss out on this one!

For this year's 25th anniversary of the Tamagotchi toy (originally came out in 1997), the egg-shaped toy is evolving into its latest iteration - in a "smart watch" form!

I really liked the mint colour and I managed to snag a preorder off Amazon Japan together with the first Smart Cards! The Tamagotchi Smart Cards are used like a physical DLC in which it lets the device download new raisable characters, wallpapers, food, clothing and even watch faces.

Preorder secured! üòÅ

This one's not out until November 23rd, but at least I no longer have to worry about scalpers and whatnot. And I will for sure be posting about it when it comes out - I can write up some translations and impressions with it as well.

See you then!
