So Covid happened.

Then I moved out and lived on my own for the first time. Yay #Adulting!

Then, that's really it. Can't go for a movie, or travel... and no conventions either. Somehow over the past 16 months, there wasn't really anything to write.

Okay, I'm lying. There's a few things I could have written, like my first _onigiri_ or _takoyaki_, but the effects of being isolated and all that stripped all of my motivation to write.

But now that we're almost at the end of all these craziness (at least where I live), I'm somehow motivated to continue posting again.

So yes, I'm not giving up just yet!

_Restarting..._
