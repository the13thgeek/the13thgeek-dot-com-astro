For my last nine days in Winnipeg, I've done some sort of countdown on my social media feed. For those nine days I would post a photo I've previously taken; associated with a memory of the adventures I've had in Winnipeg during the last 12 years.

While I chose to leave everything behind and start anew, all the memories I've had over the last 12 years with this quaint lil' prairie city - friends, family, heartbreaks, lessons, breakthroughs, misadventures and its brutal winters - I will take with me wherever I may go.

Thank you and goodbye for now, Winnipeg.
