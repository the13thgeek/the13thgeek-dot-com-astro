Mic test... one, two, three! Is this on?


```javascript
document.write("Hello world!");
```

Welcome to Field Notes!

I'm testing this new blog function on the website! I was asking around for a back-end recommendation that can handle a basic blog, and a friend referred me to Sanity.

Coming from a PHP/WordPress background, this headless/schemaless backend is new to me. I've always been used to the backend being tightly coupled to the frontend, so learning about endpoints was nothing short of mind-blowing!

I went through Sanity's basic tutorial and I got this basic dataset running and got it to seamlessly integrate with my frontend React website (the one you're reading this from now).

It reminds me of the days when I would be reading off an RSS/XML feed from an external website and using either PHP or jQuery to render it to page. It's pretty much [almost] the same, though I find working with JSON a bit easier!

So I guess you can say this is where I chronicle my journey in updating my stack and adapting to new things, and this site is where the action is.

I hope it's not yet to late to hop back into the frontend bandwagon after working in WordPress for a long time. Not abandoning WP, but figured I'd begin making a solid effort in keeping myself up-to-date.

Occasionally I'll post some non-tech stuff as well like my travels and some cool stuff!
