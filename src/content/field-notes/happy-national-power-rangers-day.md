I've been a huge fan of the Power Rangers since the very first episode aired on TV in August 28, 1993, exactly 26 years ago... and possibly even before that, thanks to my local channels airing tokusatsu favourites like _Bioman_, _Masked Rider Black_ and _Space Sheriff Shaider_.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers

Kids tend to gravitate towards these shows but most have outgrown them as soon as they hit puberty - I wasn't one of those. I reached the point when the characters and the storyline are no longer targeted towards my age group but I managed to stay a fan as there's many things and concepts that made me appreciate the series even more despite the fact that I no longer have much TV time due to increased school work and responsibilities growing up. Some of them are:

_Diversity_. A ranger team is usually comprised of 5 to 6 members - each has their own colour. As a kids' show, it's an creative way of making each character stand out in their own way. But I saw it as a subtle way of saying everyone's unique, everyone has a defining talent or characteristic that can contribute to a bigger cause. No matter what a person's background is, they are **special** in their own way. Which also brings me to...

_Inclusivity_/_Humility_. The ranger uniforms are designed to completely cover the person from head to toe - completely concealed. Many ranger teams require that their identity remain confidential for their safety. In another point of view, it implies that _anyone_ can be a superhero, that everyone is capable of doing great things. Who's that team of colourful masked heroes that saved Angel Grove? It could be you... heck, maybe it is you! It also teaches humility in the sense that while they risk their lives saving other people, they don't parade around the city in their unmorphed forms boasting the things they have done. They finish the job, making sure that no one's hurt, and they quietly fade and simply walk among the people as one of them.

_Leadership and Teamwork_. For most of the series, it's usually the Red Ranger that carries the responsibility of leading the team during a battle. He knows his team's strengths and weaknesses. He looks after them at all times. As a kid growing up in school, I looked up to most Red Rangers as an inspiration on how to be a good leader. Some episodes would even throw a curve ball and depict Red Rangers to fail, only for them to realize that they need their team to help them fight their battles. If anything, the series taught me on how to _actively listen_ to my team and their feedback. After all, _a good leader is a good follower_.

The series continue on to this day - and I'm sticking around. I've recently re-connected with the Rangers fanbase and I've met many good friends along the way who treasured and saw the series as something inspirational like I did.

Happy National Power Rangers Day to all my fellow Rangers of all ages! Let's keep the dream alive and promote positivity, friendship and teamwork! With all of these in hand, we can accomplish anything - even world peace!
