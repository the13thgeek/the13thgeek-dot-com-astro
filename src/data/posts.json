We pretty much clicked, and we have been chatting and exchanging selfies quite often. I normally am not a big fan of the hour-long trek and back to the arcade in the outskirts of the city, but the thought of being able to play my favourite game with him made it tolerable, exciting even. Sadly, he mentioned that he&#8217;s still in the closet and is unable to have a serious relationship with anyone. He apologized that we never got to hang out elsewhere other than the arcade as he was busy trying to find time for everyone. Somehow I didn&#8217;t mind all of that. I was still there for him. He would message me saying that he&#8217;s going to be there and it would be cool if I tag along with him. And here I was, smiling from ear to ear, happily making that cross-city trek just to see him. He&#8217;s fun and I enjoyed spending time with him. We had great conversations. We talked about a lot of things. Somehow silly me hoped it was mutual.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETonight we met, hung out some more at the arcade and somehow he was able to convince me to stick around longer that he even offered me a ride to my subway station. He was sharing me about some stuff in his life. I was happy to listen, knowing he sees me as a safe space, but somehow, I heard the unexpected:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHe&#8217;s already in a relationship. They met a few months ago in a dating app. He was sweet and protective of him and they&#8217;re going to meet up after he dropped me off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESomehow, I felt my insides pierced. I then realized I have grown feelings for him, but I never pushed because I knew of his situation. I didn&#8217;t want to force it, I just hoped he&#8217;d feel the same way and it would work out eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt didn&#8217;t.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was same thing over and over for the last decade or so. Either they don&#8217;t feel the same way, or maybe they could have but someone else comes in and takes that chance away from me with little to no effort at all. Sadly, there was nothing I could do about it but to accept the loss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe exact same pattern that breaks me; it&#8217;s the very thing that reminds me I am unworthy of being chosen, no matter how hard I try. It&#8217;s a recursive cruel reminder. The years, their names, the places&#8230; are all different and yet the sinking feeling remains the same. Every. Single. Time. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI smiled as I got off his car and waved goodbye. It was raining outside and I was soaking wet, and yet I was oblivious. I was stuck in place. All I could see were blobs of lights. It felt very heavy. I just stood there frozen, flashbacks of the past with the same circumstances came flooding in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt never got better. It just hurts the same way each time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Chr class=\"wp-block-separator alignwide has-alpha-channel-opacity\" /\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor most of my life, just like many people, I would try my luck at the lottery. Find happiness by chance, by probability&#8230; by luck. Funny enough, it seemed like I won on my first attempt. It was a jackpot! It&#8217;s like everything&#8217;s just amazing! It was so blissful, it felt too good to be true. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly, it was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe universe waited a few months to tell  me that the winner should have been someone else and took everything away from me, leaving me by myself, empty-handed having no idea what just hit me. The clueless young me tried to survive and push through it. I took chances again and tried, but I never won again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that first one was my only jackpot? I searched for pocket change, but sadly it was no longer enough to buy a new lottery ticket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is it for me. I&#8217;ll always remember that first one. Shortlived as it was, I will always cherish that memory of me feeling like I was in the clouds. Turns out it will never happen again. How dare I test the universe with my infinitesimal luck?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt made me question whether I may have done something terrible in the past to atone for this? I probably did, I wasn&#8217;t perfect. But what was the gravity of it; and until when am I supposed to pay for it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s over, again. My feelings want me to keep trying, but I&#8217;m too hurt and broke to keep doing it pointlessly while scraping off pieces of myself for every attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the new coins I pick up from the ground from now on, I&#8217;ll buy myself a chocolate bar instead. At least I&#8217;ll get something sweet and reciprocal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThey said it&#8217;s a waste to wish not to feel things anymore. I&#8217;m starting to think otherwise now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s probably for the best. The repeated gut punches will finally stop. The constant painful reminders of rejection will be gone. The longing for something I&#8217;ll never have will no longer bother me. The crushing feeling of getting jealous at the people who were lucky enough and the things I am willing to do and to give to be in their shoes&#8230; will come to an end. I took risks and walked away with the short end of the stick, without fail, every time. And I&#8217;m tired of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI&#8217;ll no longer have to go through all of that again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere&#8217;s no more luck to push, I&#8217;m done trying. It is exhausting. Winning must be nice, it seemed warm and fuzzy. I&#8217;ve always wished for it. But I&#8217;ll never have it. Looks like that kind of life isn&#8217;t meant for me. Suddenly the thought of that sweet chocolate bar felt comforting to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI&#8217;m not buying lottery tickets anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Chr class=\"wp-block-separator alignwide has-alpha-channel-opacity\" /\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArriving at Osgoode&#8230; Osgoode Station.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was swimming in a lot of thoughts that I completely lost track of time and I almost missed my stop. I hoped no one noticed what kind of quiet mess I was in the train. It was a long ride and it&#8217;s still raining outside. I paid little care and stepped out into the drizzly night and reminded myself that this will be the last time I will feel this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the rain.

It was a freezing cold New Year&#8217;s Eve but I was excited, because I&#8217;m going to be meeting up with someone I met on Tinder to grab some dinner and maybe hang out and some movies later. But they bailed on me literally half an hour before our agreed meetup time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping I could hang out and spend New Year&#8217;s Eve with my roommate at the time, but he already had plans. I ended up eating dinner by myself on the place where I was supposed to meet up my would-have-been date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI got back alone to the quiet apartment. I tried putting on a movie, but I felt too miserable I ended up just staring at the screen and I had to turn the TV off halfway into the movie. The overwhelming loneliness made me broke down on the couch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKnowing that I&#8217;ll be spending New Year&#8217;s lonely, I called up work and I asked if I can work a shift on January 1st instead of just spending the rest of the day in the apartment alone. I recomposed myself after what felt like forever on the couch and did a quick light photography shoot of myself drawing #22. I posted it on Instagram as my first post of the year and calling it &#8220;\u003Cem\u003EHopes and dreams\u003C/em\u003E.&#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI promised myself it won&#8217;t be like this again next year and I tucked myself into bed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was 9:45 PM. F*ck the countdown, I&#8217;m done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJanuary 1, 2022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s -37C before factoring in the wind. It&#8217;s been in the -30s for weeks now and I woke up at 6 AM to get ready for my early morning shift. Working outside in the brutal cold? I&#8217;d rather freeze than stay in the empty apartment because it will only remind me why I&#8217;m not worth anyone&#8217;s time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Chr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" /\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDecember 31, 2022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was my first New Year&#8217;s Eve in Toronto. I spent the entire evening in downtown and the waterfront to watch the festivities and the fireworks. I was by myself, but there&#8217;s so much things going on and transit was free so there was a lot people that I never felt lonely. The place was just alive and hopping.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked at the fireworks and smiled at the spectacle. I was listening to the host of the program.

A big one!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a few days ago, I moved from Winnipeg to Toronto!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt&#8217;s been a huge endeavour, I&#8217;ve always wanted to move here and almost did a few times in the past, but it wasn&#8217;t completely feasible until recently.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst task was to find a sublet for my apartment, which wasn&#8217;t easy. Winnipeg&#8217;s having one of its worst winters in decades and I was at my wit&#8217;s end trying to deal with people who were interested in a viewing but never showed up (trust me, there was a lot of them). But somehow, just near the end of March, someone was genuinely interested and applied and not even two days later I received a notice that I needed to be out of there by the 31st. First five seconds was like &#8220;yay, Toronto!&#8221; and then \u003Cem\u003Eoh crap\u003C/em\u003E right after I realized I have 9 days to vacate.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOver the next few days I was in a frantic mode packing, selling and asking for quotes from different moving companies. With the help of some friends, somehow I managed to get the logistics done. From buying boxes and packing materials, selling and giving away some of the large/bulky stuff and furniture and transporting my belongings to the storage warehouse for moving &#8211; somehow it all worked out in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last few bits were basically to find an apartment in Toronto and grab plane tickets. Since it&#8217;s a very short notice and it&#8217;s a one-way flight, it ended up being very expensive but that&#8217;s just how it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EApril 1st was the big day.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-attachment-id=\"1021\" data-permalink=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/2022/04/04/fromywgtoyyz/ywg-cookie-monster/\" data-orig-file=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1153\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ywg-cookie-monster\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1021\" srcset=\"https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=2046 2046w, https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=150 150w, https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=300 300w, https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg?w=768 768w, https://the13thgeek.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ywg-cookie-monster.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /\u003E\u003Cfigcaption\u003EThank you for the 12 years, Winnipeg!\u003C/figcaption\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a friend in Toronto who was nice enough to let us stay in his place for the first few days while we look for a new apartment.

It features an all-white body (as a homage to the very first Tamagotchi design released in 1996, and it comes with a SmaCard featuring nostalgic items and pixel-based raisable characters. This was supposedly only released through a lottery in Japan but it looks like many people won the said lottery and some were selling theirs online. I managed to find someone selling theirs for a reasonable price (some were already scalped like crazy), and I couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to get it early so I bit the bullet.
